# REQUIREMENTS

#INTRODUCTION: The Airline Booking System project is the application based mini project, which is used to book airline ticket and cancelling booked ticket. The tool used for writing the code in this project is visual studio code. This project has multi file and multiplatform approach (Linux and Windows).

#RESEARCH

People who have technical knowledge of booking the airline ticket in online, can use this application to booking ticket, search the ticket, view the passenger details, cancelling the ticket and used for updating username and password for login.


Defining System:

Design and testing operations of Airline Booking System using unit testing algorithm.

SWOT analysis:

Strengths: An Airline booking system is very important because it has the strong ability to reduce errors that might have occurred when using a manual system of reservation  and  helps  speed  up  the  boarding  process.

Weakness: The problems are inability of passengers to select their preferred  seat(s) from the  reservation system, No option of passengers printing  their boarding pass, non-notification  of passengers of flight cancellation or delays and passengers don‘t  have access to  aircraft  maintenance  report  to  ease the fears associated with air travel and its disasters.

Opportunities: The need of this system  was  realized  since  the beginning stages of the airline industry when information such as routes, aircrafts, schedules and fares about flights was  published by airlines in  large books. Travel agents had the  difficult task of  looking into  separate  books for reservations that involve multiple airlines. It was a dream to  get  a  real  time  picture  of  available  seats  because airlines  share  information  at  day  end  only.

Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.
