## SWOT analysis

Strengths: 
An Airline booking system is very important because it has the strong ability to reduce errors that might have occurred when using a manual system of reservation  and  helps  speed  up  the  boarding  process.


Weakness: 
The problems are inability of passengers to select their preferred  seat(s) from the  reservation system, No option of passengers printing  their boarding pass, non-notification  of passengers of flight cancellation or delays and passengers donâ€˜t  have access to  aircraft  maintenance  report  to  ease the fears associated with air travel and its disasters.


Opportunities: 
The need of this system was realized since the beginning stages of the airline industry when information such as routes, aircrafts, schedules and fares about flights was published by airlines in large books. Travel agents had the difficult task of looking into separate books for reservations that involve multiple airlines. It was a dream to get a real time picture of available seats because airlines share information at day end only.


Threats: 
Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.
